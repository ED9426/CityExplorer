CityInterface.java: Extends Comparable<CityInterface> and groups methods, including getCity(), getState(), getCountry(), getCostIndex(), and compareTo(), that will be implemented to return specific information of a City object.

City.java: Implements all the methods in CityInterface and overrides an additional method toString that returns all the information of a City object.

CityDataReaderInterface.java: Groups a method readDataSet() that reads in either a FileReader object (for a file path) or a StringReader object (for raw data), processes data into City objects, and stores data in a CityInterface list.

CityDataReader.java: Implements readDataSet() in CityDataReaderInterface to read in city data and parse them into a CityInterface list.

DataWranglerTests.java: Tests all the methods implemented in City.java and CityDataReader.java.
